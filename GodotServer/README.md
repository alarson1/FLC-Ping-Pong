# FLCServerTemplate

FLCServerTemplate is a foundational repository designed to streamline the development of FLC Solar Lab applications. It provides a structured base for integrating real-time visualizations with scientific simulations, supporting synchronization between physical and digital environments.

The template includes:
- A Godot 4.3 project pre-configured to serve 3D visualizations and synchronize data with HMD clients via NOODLES.
- A Python Flask service template for hosting and serving results from scientific simulations, such as solar PV models.

This repository serves as a flexible starting point, allowing researchers and developers to build and extend new Solar Lab applications. 

[IrradianceSim](https://github.com/FLC-Solar-Lab/IrradianceSim.git) is a lightweight demonstration application built using FLCServerTemplate, 
illustrating a minimal working example. By using IrradianceSim as a reference, developers can quickly extend FLCServerTemplate to create 
more complex applications tailored to Solar Lab research and education.

Full documentation for the FLC Solar Lab can be found the top-level [README.md](https://github.com/FLC-Solar-Lab/IrradianceSim.git)
